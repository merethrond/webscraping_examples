## cris_result_calculation.py
As the file name suggests, there was an entrance exam of a govt. organisation called CRIS. The results along with the answer key
was declared, but it was not explicitly mentioned how much was my score. This script achieves exactly that. 

Here BeautifulSoup and Numpy libraries are used to find each answered problem, unanswered problems and correct answers of the 
problems. They all are stored in a list and then added to calculate the scores achieved.

### How to run:
Python 3 is used here, so just run the script in the command line to get the printed out results in the console itself.
